# MIDASIntern

### Description

Hey there This website is made as a part for qualifying IIITD internship program. I made this website using PHP,HTML,CSS,JS and MySql as a database. It walks you through the MIDAS Lab at IIITD and show all its features in it.

# Requirements

1 -> Apache and MySQL server

# How to Set Up Locally

To set it up locally follow the steps given below:

1 -> Set Up Apache and MySQL server. For Windows users you can install xampp and start Apache and MySQL Server.

2 -> Clone the repository using command git clone and save the filed under name of app folder in xampp/httdocs

3 -> Go to PhpMyadmin Panel to set up the MySQL Database. You can go to PhpMyAdmin by typing localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser

4 -> Go to the import section of PhpMyAdmin Panel and select the user.sql file from my repository that you cloned and then click on import to import the database.

5 -> Now you are all set to start running the website, type localhost/app/index.html

As the part of the internship qualification I was told to host the website, but there were no free Web hosting for php and mysql database. All of them were asking credit card details.

For more details or any help on setting it up, please fell free to ask.
